Modification Date: October 22, 2025

ORIGINAL PROJECT

Original project: Return YouTube Dislike

     * Disabled premium feature initialization
     * All functions now return false/null/none

3. Modified Files:

     * Removed: import { initPatreonFeatures } from "./src/patreon"
     * Removed: initPatreonFeatures() call

   - Extensions/combined/popup.js
     * Removed entire initPatreonAuth() function (~250 lines)

     * Kept only basic ratio bar styling

   - Extensions/combined/_locales/en/messages.json
     * Updated extension name to "Return YouTube Dislike - Free"
     * Updated extension description to mention "Free Edition (no paywalls)"
     * Updated donation message to reference GPL v3 fork
     * Updated developer attribution to credit original authors

4. What Remains:
   - Core dislike counting functionality
   - Ratio bar display
   - Vote submission to API
   - All original non-premium features
   - Full YouTube integration (regular videos and Shorts)

IMPORTANT LIMITATIONS
---------------------
The actual premium analytics data (charts, country breakdowns, activity timelines)
is server-side API-protected and cannot be bypassed. This fork only removes the
client-side UI prompts and paywalls. The core dislike counting functionality
remains fully operational.
